1. npm init vue@latest

2. npm install

3. "delete its default and unnecessary files for you"

4. npm install -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest

5. npx tailwindcss init -p --full
 
6.  change 
                            content:[], 
    in tailwind.config.js to 
                            content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{vue,js,ts,jsx,tsx}", ], 

7. Open the main.css file inside the src folder and write this code 

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

8. Add this code to the "scripts" section of package.json
     "tailwind": "npx tailwindcss -i ./src/main.css -o ./src/output.css --watch", 

9. write this command in terminal npm run tailwind

10. if the output.css file is created inside the src folder everything is going fine

11. Add this code to your main.js file
            import "./output.css";

12. Tailwind is now connected locally. For global installation, just index.html file
     <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
  code is enough, but it doesn't offer any helper words

13. Now everything works!
